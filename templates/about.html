            <p align="justify">Cars are one of the biggest financial purchases in your life.
                    In your lifetime, you'll spend over five years in one. Yet all too often,
                    from search to the sale, buyers and sellers dread the process.<br>

                    From your first car to your fifteenth, we want to make buying and selling a car
                    something you can look forward to. Weâ€™re taking a data driven and user centric approach to
                    create new and better ways to buy and sell cars.Like other vehicles, cars are made in different
                    shapes and sizes, for people with different needs. Some small "city" cars carry only two to four people,
                    with only small space for luggage. Other types are able to carry many passengers or heavy loads.<br>

                    For example, station wagons or estate cars carry from 5 to 9 people, or fewer people with lots of luggage.
                    There are many different sizes of vans, such as minivans, which are made for families, and even small pickup trucks,
                    which are car-like vehicles made for carrying medium-sized loads; for example, goods for delivery or plumber's and
                    builder's tools and materials. Heavy lorries are used to carry deliveries and heavy loads.<br>

                    In order for a car to work, it must have a power source, where the car gets the energy it needs to turn the wheels.
                    Most cars use some kind of fuel to make an internal combustion engine run. The power from the engine then goes to the
                    wheels through a transmission, which has a set of gears that makes the car go faster or slower. The most common fuel
                    in small to medium-size cars is petrol, which is called gasoline in America (people just call it "gas" though).
                    Some cars burn diesel fuel, which is used in big trucks and buses, and a few use wood gas. In some countries,
                    such as Brazil and Sweden, a mixture of ethanol and petrol, called gasohol in Brazil and E-85 in Sweden,
                    is used as automobile fuel. There are cars designed to run on more than one type of fuel - these are called
                    "flex-fuel" and are very rare.<br>
